This project demonstrates a complete Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) workflow using Python. The goal is to extract the top 10 largest banks by market capitalization (USD), transform the data into GBP, EUR, and INR using the provided `exchange_rate.csv`, and load the processed data into both CSV and SQLite database formats. A detailed process log is also maintained throughout execution.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Extract market capitalization data from an archived web source.  
- Clean and structure the raw data into a pandas DataFrame.  
- Convert USD market capitalization into GBP, EUR, and INR.  
- Save transformed data into a CSV file and SQLite database.  
- Log all major steps using a structured log file (`code_log.txt`).  
- Provide a clean, reproducible ETL workflow.

## 🔄 ETL Workflow

### 1. Extract
- Scraped the “By market capitalization” table from the archived Wikipedia page.  
- Cleaned values and extracted the top 10 largest banks by USD market cap.

### 2. Transform
- Loaded exchange rates from `exchange_rate.csv`.  
- Calculated market capitalization in GBP, EUR, and INR.  
- Rounded transformed values to two decimal places.  
- Reordered DataFrame columns to match project requirements.

### 3. Load
- Saved the final DataFrame to `Largest_banks_data.csv`.  
- Loaded the processed data into `Banks.db` under the table name `Largest_banks`.

### 4. Logging
All major steps write timestamped entries into `code_log.txt` using:
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS : <message>

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook located at:  
Notebook/world_top_banks.ipynb
2. Run all cells in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
3. Ensure `exchange_rate.csv` is present in the Data directory.  
4. The output CSV, database, and logs will be recreated upon execution.
